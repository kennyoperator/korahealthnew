const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'What is retatrutide and how does it work?',
    a: 'Retatrutide is a triple-agonist injectable that activates GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors simultaneously. It reduces appetite, improves blood sugar control, increases resting energy expenditure, and supports significant weight loss. In Phase 3 trials, participants lost an average of 28.7% of their body weight.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does retatrutide cost?',
    a: 'The price is ₱4,500 ($80 USD) per vial. This includes pharmaceutical-grade retatrutide, injection supplies, FDA-regulated compounding, third-party testing, and free nationwide cold-chain delivery. No hidden fees.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a prescription?',
    a: "Yes. After you place your order, you'll complete a medical intake form. A licensed Philippine physician will review your profile within 24 hours. If approved, your prescription is sent to our FDA-regulated pharmacy and your order ships within 2–5 days.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Is retatrutide safe?',
    a: 'Retatrutide has been studied in large clinical trials involving hundreds of participants. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation — primarily during dose escalation. A unique side effect called dysesthesia (skin tingling) was observed in approximately 21% of participants at the highest dose, though it was generally mild. Your physician will evaluate your full health history and monitor you throughout treatment.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is medication delivered?',
    a: 'All medications are shipped in temperature-controlled packaging using cold-chain logistics from pharmacy to your doorstep. Delivery takes 2–5 business days nationwide.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to inject myself?',
    a: 'Yes, retatrutide is a once-weekly self-injection. We provide detailed video guidance and your care team can walk you through it live. Most patients find it straightforward after the first time.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
    a: 'Yes. You can pause or cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard. No penalties, no lock-ins.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does retatrutide compare to Ozempic or Mounjaro?',
    a: 'Retatrutide targets three receptors (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon) compared to one for semaglutide (Ozempic) and two for tirzepatide (Mounjaro). Clinical trials show approximately 28.7% weight loss with retatrutide versus 20.2% for tirzepatide and 14.9% for semaglutide.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where in the Philippines can I order?',
    a: 'Kora Health delivers nationwide. We serve patients across Metro Manila — Makati, BGC, Quezon City — as well as Cebu, Davao, and throughout the Philippines.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    a: 'We accept GCash, Maya, bank transfer, and all major credit cards. All pricing is in Philippine pesos with no hidden fees.',
  },
